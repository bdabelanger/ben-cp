# AGENTS.md — Vault Agent Dispatch

## Handoff Check (Every Session Start)

Before doing any other work, check for outstanding handoffs:

1. List `handoff/` at vault root (root only — not `handoff/complete/`)
2. Any `.md` file present is an open handoff — completed ones live in `handoff/complete/`
3. Surface them to Ben immediately: "You have N outstanding handoff(s): [filenames]"
4. If Ben confirms, execute using the handoff protocol at `skills/handoff/index.md`

Do not proceed with other work until open handoffs are acknowledged by Ben.

## Who Are You?

Find your role file and read it next:

| Agent | Role file | Role summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Claude (Cowork) | `agents/claude.md` | Architect, session lead, skill builder |
| Claude Code | `agents/claude-code.md` | Implementer, code executor, file engineer |
| Gemma | `agents/gemma.md` | Executor, pipeline tasks, data formatting |
| *(future)* Antigravity | `agents/antigravity.md` | TBD |

## MCP Tools

This vault exposes purpose-built MCP tools. Use them instead of raw file reads/writes where available:

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_changelog` | Read changelog entries — pass a scope (`root`, `skills/okr-reporting`, etc.) to pull relevant recent work |
| `write_changelog_entry` | Append a new entry — always write deepest level first, then root |

**Session pattern:**
1. `get_changelog` scoped to the work area → understand recent context
2. Load `AGENTS.md` + your role file → confirm rules
3. Do the work
4. `write_changelog_entry` at subdirectory level → then at root

Ben will tell you which changelog scope is relevant for the session. If not specified, ask before pulling root.

## Universal Rules (All Agents)

### Read → Write Protocol (MANDATORY)

1. **Before editing an existing file:** read it first with `read_text_file`
2. **Before creating a new file:** list the parent directory to confirm it doesn't exist
3. **For targeted changes:** use `edit_file`, never `write_file` on existing files
4. **`write_file` is for net-new files only** — using it on an existing file is a destructive overwrite
5. **If a read fails:** stop and report — do not proceed with a write

### File Placement

| Content type | Correct location |
| :--- | :--- |
| KR-specific measurement SOP | `skills/okr-reporting/[name].md` |
| Master OKR runbook (evergreen) | `skills/okr-reporting/procedure.md` |
| Quarterly KR reference | `skills/okr-reporting/[year]-[quarter]-kr-reference.md` |
| Data source inventory | `skills/okr-reporting/data_sources.md` |
| Status/transform logic | `skills/skill-builder/mappings/` |
| Visual/emoji standards | `skills/skill-builder/styles/` |
| Crypt-Keeper watchdog | `skills/crypt-keeper/` |
| Changelog procedure | `skills/changelog/` |
| Other skill SOPs | `skills/[skill-name]/` |
| Cleanup reports | `reports/cleanup-report-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` |

**Never create files at vault root** (except `AGENTS.md`, `GEMMA.md`, `changelog.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`).

### File Naming

- Underscores for word separation: `notes_datagrid_shortcuts.md`
- KR SOPs: `[feature]_[metric_type].md`
- Quarterly references: `[year]-[quarter]-kr-reference.md`
- No spaces, no camelCase

### Index Maintenance

After creating or significantly modifying any file, update `index.md` in the same directory.

### Completion Reporting

Every session ends with a changelog entry — use `write_changelog_entry` or follow `skills/changelog/index.md`.

## When in Doubt

Ask Ben rather than improvising structure. Do not delete files — flag for review.
